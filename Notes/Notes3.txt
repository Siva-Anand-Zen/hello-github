Git Branch

A branch in Git is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment in isolation from the main codebase. The default branch in most repositories is called `main` or `master`.

Key Commands:
1. Create a new branch:
    ```
    git branch <branch-name>
    ```

2. Switch to a branch:
    ```
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```
    or (modern syntax):
    ```
    git switch <branch-name>
    ```

3. Create and switch to a new branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
    or:
    ```
    git switch -c <branch-name>
    ```

4. List all branches:
    ```
    git branch
    ```

5. Delete a branch:
    ```
    git branch -d <branch-name>
    ```

6. Merge a branch into the current branch:
    ```
    git merge <branch-name>
    ```

Branches allow for parallel development and make it easier to manage changes in a collaborative environment. Always remember to push your branches to the remote repository if you want others to access them:
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
