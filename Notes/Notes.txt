GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, tracking changes, and collaborating with others.

Key features of GitHub include:
- **Repositories**: Centralized locations to store and manage code.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to files and allows reverting to previous versions.
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project using branches and pull requests.
- **Issues and Project Management**: Tools for tracking bugs, feature requests, and project progress.
- **Actions**: Automates workflows like testing, building, and deploying code.
- **Community**: A vast ecosystem of open-source projects and contributors.

GitHub is widely used by developers, teams, and organizations to streamline software development and foster collaboration.
